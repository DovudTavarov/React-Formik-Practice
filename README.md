- **Validation**: The form includes validation rules to ensure users enter valid information (e.g., required fields, valid email, etc.).
- **Data Table**: Displays all the entered user data in a table format.
- **Formik Integration**: Uses **Formik** to manage form state and validation.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Utilizes **Bootstrap** to style the form and table components for a clean, responsive layout.

## Technologies Used
